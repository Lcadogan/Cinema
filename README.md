# Cinema-Room-REST-Service

In this project, I created a simple Spring REST service that will help us manage a small movie theater.
Handled HTTP requests in controllers, created services, and responded with JSON objects.
REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue.
